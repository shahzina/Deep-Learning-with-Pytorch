# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch
DL with pytorch workbooks. Udacity Deep Learning.

This workbook is a practice of deep learning with pytorch lesson of the course. It's divided into 8 parts starting with a simple lesson about tensors and ending at transfer learning. These projects involve MNIST, fashion-MNIST and Cat-Dog image data and have been divided in to workbooks based on the topic they are dealing with. 

## PyTorch Workbook 1

#### Part 1 Tensors in PyTorch

This section describes the simple layout of a perceptron and calculates the output using matrix multiplication and then adds another layer, defines the weights and biases and then computes the output using pytorch matrix multiplication.

#### Part 2 Neural Networks in PyTorch
