# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch
DL with pytorch workbook. Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This workbook is a practice of deep learning with pytorch lesson of the course. It's divided into 8 parts starting with a simple lesson about tensors and ending at transfer learning. 

### Part 1 Tensors in PyTorch

This section describes the simple layout of a perceptron and calculates the output using matrix multiplication and then adds another layer, defines the weights and biases and then computes the output using pytorch matrix multiplication.

### Part 2 Neural Networks in PyTorch
